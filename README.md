ETL Movies for AmazingPrime Video Hackathon

AmazingPrime Video, a platform for steaming movies & TV shows, wants to host a hackathon.  The aim is to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy streaming rights at a good deal.

The team is tasked to extract & transfom data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, and load that cleaned data into a database for the competitors to access.

Note 1:  ratings.csv was not uploaded to github due to its size \(too large\).

Note 2: wikipedia.movies.json & movies_metadata.csv are located in the main folder.  movies_query.png & ratings_query.png are located in the Resources folder.
